## CIPHER — Calibrated Introspection via Partially Hidden Environment Rules

Most benchmarks test whether a model knows the right answer. CIPHER tests something harder: whether a model knows what it doesn't know.

Each instance is a procedurally generated micro-world with its own causal rules, expressed in entirely invented vocabulary — made-up entity names, made-up property words, made-up causal language. Some rules are partially hidden. The model must reason about a system it can't fully observe, decide which gaps in its knowledge matter most, and commit to a plan while honestly assessing how robust that plan actually is.

Because every instance is generated fresh from abstract math with a random seed, memorization is impossible. A model that scores well on CIPHER has genuinely reasoned under uncertainty — not pattern-matched on training data.

### What gets scored

Responses are evaluated on four dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it captures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Objective** | 35% | Plan quality vs. oracle beam search on the hidden ground truth |
| **Calibration** | 25% | Brier score on the model's stated confidence about what it knows |
| **Attention** | 20% | Rank correlation between model-flagged unknowns and ground-truth importance |
| **Executive** | 20% | Structural quality: named risks, alternative plans, probe strategy |

No single strategy dominates all four. A model that greedily optimizes the plan scores well on objective but poorly on calibration and attention. A model that hedges everything scores decent calibration but a weak objective. The benchmark is specifically designed so that genuine metacognitive reasoning — knowing what you don't know and acting accordingly — is the only path to a strong composite score.

### Baseline reference points

| Agent | Composite | Objective | Calibration | Attention | Executive |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| stub-noop | 0.408 | 0.486 | 0.750 | 0.000 | 0.250 |
| stub-random | 0.511 | 0.484 | 0.663 | 0.211 | 0.670 |
| stub-greedy | 0.623 | 1.000 | 0.893 | 0.000 | 0.250 |

The greedy stub runs oracle beam search on the visible rules — it achieves a perfect objective score but never identifies what it doesn't know, so calibration and attention collapse. Real models should beat the composite meaningfully, and the interesting question is *how* they beat it.
